# Master's Amulet

## Features

Adds functionality for the Master's Amulet magic item from the 5e SRD.

## Setup instructions

With the 5e SRD Bestiary (or something else with the Shield Guardian) module loaded, place the Shield Guardian from NPCs into the Combat Tracker.

Have the Shield Guardian target the character wearing the amulet and double click "is magically bound" in the Shield Guardian statblock.

At this point you shouldn't need to do anything but if you do need to turn the effect off temporarily, the simplest way is to switch off the bound effect with the toggle button in the combat tracker.
